### Potential Package Names

- `barrelize` - A catchy verb suggesting the tool will “barrel” your files 
  (convert and bundle them into barrel files automatically).
- `barreled` - Implies your code is now neatly “barreled” up. This name echoes 
  the style of packages like `freezed`, giving a sense that your exports have 
  been gathered into a barrel.
- `exported` - Straightforward and memorable. It indicates that the package 
  deals with exports (fitting the pattern of `json_serializable`/`freezed`, an 
  adjective describing the code’s state after generation).
- `auto_barrel` - Clear and concise. Reflects the automation aspect (like 
  `auto_route`) by automatically creating barrel files for you.
- `barrel_roll` - A fun, unique name (inspired by the phrase “do a barrel 
  roll”). It suggests rolling up your files into a barrel. Memorable and still 
  hinting at barrel file functionality.
- `cooper` - A cooper is a craftsman who makes barrels. This name is short, 
  on-theme, and implies the package “builds” barrel files for your project.
- `curator` - A curator assembles and manages collections (like museum pieces). 
  By analogy, this name hints that the tool curates your exports into a single 
  collection (barrel file). It’s unique yet relevant to organizing code.
- `umbrella` - Conveys the idea of an umbrella file that covers all exports. 
  Short and metaphorical, it fits with Dart’s preference for concise package 
  names while suggesting “one file to rule them all.”
